## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

- **URL (Uniform Resource Locator):** A URL is a reference or address used to access resources on the internet. It consists of several components, including the scheme, domain name, path, query parameters, and fragment identifier.

- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems.

- **Reading a URL:** Understanding how to break down a URL into its components, such as scheme, domain name, path, and query parameters.

- **Scheme for an HTTP URL:** The scheme indicates the protocol used, such as "http" or "https," in a URL.

- **Domain Name:** A domain name is a human-readable label assigned to an IP address, representing a specific location on the internet.

- **Sub-Domain:** A sub-domain is a domain that is part of a larger domain. For example, in "sub.domain.com," "sub" is the sub-domain.

- **Port Number in a URL:** How to define and understand the significance of port numbers in a URL.

- **Query String:** A query string is a part of a URL that contains data to be passed to a web server as key-value pairs.

- **HTTP Request:** An HTTP request is a message sent from a client to a server, specifying an action to be performed.

- **HTTP Response:** An HTTP response is a message sent by a server to a client, containing the result of the requested action.

- **HTTP Headers:** HTTP headers provide additional information about the request or response, such as content type, length, and encoding.

- **HTTP Message Body:** The HTTP message body contains the data associated with an HTTP request or response.

- **HTTP Request Method:** The HTTP request method specifies the desired action to be performed for a given resource.

- **HTTP Response Status Code:** An HTTP status code indicates the outcome of an HTTP request. Common codes include 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), and 500 (Internal Server Error).

- **HTTP Cookie:** An HTTP cookie is a small piece of data stored on the user's computer by the web browser, allowing the server to recognize the user.

- **cURL Request:** Understanding how to make HTTP requests using cURL, a command-line tool for transferring data.

- **Browser Navigation (Application Level):** Explaining the process that occurs when you type a URL like "google.com" into your browser's address bar.
